# Code Commandos

Me and my team participated in an event **"Bug Hunt"** organized by in their college fest named as **"Vashisht"** organized by **IIITDM Kancheepuram** where we contributed by finding the bug, creating the issue and pull request to a GitHub repo which consists of a total of **27 files** where **15 consist of C/C++ code** and **12 of python code**.

Below is the rules of the BugHunt Vashisht Rules.

# üêûBugHunt Vashisht 2024 Rulesüêû

- You can participate in teams of up to 3 members.
  
- A git repo containing programs written in C/Cpp/Python will be provided to you which may or may not contain bugs.
  
- Your aim is to find and remove bugs (will be called hunted from now on) from the programs.
  
- You will be provided with the link to the repo containing once the event commends.
  
- Make a fork of the repo and clone it onto your PC.
  
- You should raise an issue once you find a bug or hunt a bug. Raise only one issue per team. If you only found the bug, mention found a bug in program.c/py at line 'x' in the issue. You need to visit a [site](https://encrypt.bitgarden.tech/) where you need to fill in these details and it will give you an encrypted text. You need to copy the text and submit that in the issue.
If you hunt a bug, make a commit including only the changes you made to that specific program (only one program per commit). For example, if I found a bug and successfully removed it from a program named p1.c there should be a commit with the changes you made to the p1.c in your fork repo.

- At the end of the event you need to open a pull request to the main event repo.
  
- Identifying a bug and reporting will fetch you 100 points and successfully removing it will fetch you another 100 points, i.e., if you just report a bug in a particular program you will get 100 points for that. In addition to that if you also hunt the bug you will be awarded with 100 + 100 = 200 points.
  
- Winners will be decided based on the points a team scores.
  
- In case if 2 teams get the same number of points, the team which hunted most bugs will be given priority. If it is still a tie then the team which raised their last issue first will be given priority.

- Good Luck and let the Hunting begin!!
